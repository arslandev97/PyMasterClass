# Python Comments 

# USe of Comments 
# Comments can be used to explain Python code.
# Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
# Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
# interpretor ignore commments which means interpreter never execute comments

# There are Two types of Comments in Python
# 1. Single Line Comments 
# 2. Multi-line Comments

# 1. Single Line Comments
# We can make single line comment using # (hash) sign
# jis line ke start me hash lagayeen gy woh comments ban jay gyee


# 2. Multi-Line Comments 
# Multiline comments are used for large text descriptions of code or to comment out chunks of code while debugging applications. Comments are ignored by the intrepretor/compiler.
