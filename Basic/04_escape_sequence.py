# Escape Sequence Characters 
'''
Escape sequence characters are special characters used in strings to represent certain non-printable or special characters. 

They are preceded by a backslash \ to indicate that they have a special meaning and should be treated differently from regular characters.

Here are some commonly used escape sequence characters in Python:

\n:         Represents a newline character and is used to start a new line.
\t:         Represents a tab character and is used for indentation or creating tabular spacing.
\" or \':   Represents a double quote or a single quote character, respectively, within a string enclosed by the corresponding quotation marks.

\\:         Represents a literal backslash character.
\b:         Represents a backspace character and is used to move the cursor back one space.
\r:         Represents a carriage return and is used to return the cursor to the beginning of the current line.
\f:         Represents a form feed character and is used to advance the printer to the next page or form.

# Here's an example that demonstrates the use of escape sequence characters:

print("Hello\nWorld")  # Prints "Hello" on one line and "World" on the next line
print("This is a\ttab")  # Prints "This is a    tab" with tab spacing
print("She said, \"Hello!\"")  # Prints the sentence with double quotes included
print("C:\\path\\to\\file")  # Prints "C:\path\to\file" with literal backslashes


# Escape sequence characters allow us to include special characters in strings and control the formatting and presentation of text.



# Split the line after .
print("My Name is Muhammad Arslan. \nI'm From Pakistan")


# \n is used to break the line and Shift content to the new line Ater it.

# Task 1 : Print the given line as it is in the print statement.
# \n is a new Line character

print("\\n is a new Line character")

# print("\\t is tab character used to insert 4 spaces")
print("Hello\tWorld!")


# Print country name in double or single quotes
print("Hello Everyone! I am Arslan from \"Pakistan\"")
print("Hello Everyone! I am Arslan from 'Pakistan'")



# print('Hello Everyone! I am Arslan from \'Pakistan\'')


# print("*************************")
# print("*                       *")
# print("*                       *")
# print("*                       *")
# print("*                       *")
# print("*                       *")
# print("*************************")


# print("    *   ")
# print("   ***   ")
# print("  *****   ")
# print(" ********   ")



print("Hello,\nWorld!")
