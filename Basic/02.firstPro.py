# Run Our First program in Python

# use of print statement
# The print statement in Python is used to display output on the console or terminal. 
# It allows you to print messages, variables, or any other information you want to display while running your program.

# syntax of print statement
print("Welcome to the Python Mastry Course")

# Keyword : print
# round braces : ()
# Write your message in single or double quotes : ' ' , " "

print('Thsis String line is written in Single Quotes')


# Wrong Syntax 
# # this line generates an error because we didn't follow the syntax

# Print("Print function with capital P")  # you have written Print with capital P, which is incorrect. 
# PRINT("Print function with capital P")  # you have written PRINT with capital letters, which is incorrect. 
# print(Print function with capital P) # in this we didn't write or string in Single ' ' or double quotes " "


# reason of error : Case Sensitiveness
# Python is a case sensitive programming language. 
# you have written Print and PRINT with capital letters, which is incorrect. 
# Python will treat these as separate identifiers, not as the built-in print function.

# print()
# Print() # this Print is different from this "print" 


# Error : Bug : Debug mean indentify and fix any error/bug
# While coding, we often encounter many errors, and some of these errors include:



# 1. Syntax Error 
# These occur when there are mistakes in the structure or grammar of the code. Examples include missing parentheses or quotation marks, misspelled keywords, or incorrect indentation.
# This error caught by interpretor

# PRINT("Incorrect  Syntax")
# print("Correct Syntax")


# 2. Logical Error
# These errors occur when the code runs without any error messages, but the output or behavior is not what was intended. Logical errors can happen when there is a mistake in the algorithm or the logic of the code.
# Syntax is correct but the logic is incorrect 

# Write a program to add two numbers 
print(10-10) # logical error : add kerna tha but galti se minus ker diya 


# 3. Run Time Error
# These occur during the execution of the code. 
# They are often caused by issues like dividing by zero, accessing invalid indices in a list, or using variables that have not been defined.



# Langague Translator
# Translate HUman code in to machine code

# There are two types of translator exist in programming languages
# 1. Interpretor
# 2. Compiler


# Interprtor   ---> Translator
# an interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language
# Line by line execution 
# print("Welcome to Pakistan")


# Compiler 
#  a compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language into another language
# Compile whole code at once


# What is difference between interpreter and compiler?
# A Compiler takes a program as a whole. An Interpreter takes single lines of a code. The Compilers generate intermediate machine codes. The Interpreters never generate any intermediate machine codes.
